# protest-mapping

This is an application created for the Daily Californian to visualize the movements of a protest happening.
It uses the Twitter Stream with tweets that have geolocation enabled and follows a certain keyword. 
These tweets are plotted on the map, and a line is drawn in an infinite loop to show the progress.
